# The mechanism of system work:
- Raspberry pi using camera will detect seat-belt and drowsiness
- Bluetooth module acts as a link between Raspberry and microcontroller , it sends information from raspberry pi to microcontroller if there is no seat-belt or drowsiness occurs
- Car avoids accident by self-parking .
